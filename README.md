This project focuses on analyzing salary trends and job satisfaction within the data industry using Power BI. The goal was to provide insights into salary distributions, popular programming languages, work-life balance, and overall job satisfaction, which could be valuable for professionals and employers in the industry.

## What I Did:

- **Data Collection and Preparation:** The project started by collecting survey data from professionals in the data industry. I cleaned and transformed the data to ensure accuracy and consistency, using tools like Power Query within Power BI.

- **Dashboard Creation:** I developed a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI that visualized key metrics such as average salaries by job title, popular programming languages, work-life balance scores, and job satisfaction levels.

- **Data Analysis:** I conducted an in-depth analysis of the data to uncover trends in salary distribution, the impact of job titles on earnings, and the correlation between programming language proficiency and salary.

## Data Analysis:

- **Salary Distribution:** Analyzed salary data across various job titles to identify trends and highlight the most lucrative positions in the data industry.

- **Programming Languages:** Assessed the popularity of different programming languages, such as Python and SQL, and their impact on salary levels.

- **Work-Life Balance and Job Satisfaction:** Explored how professionals in the industry perceive their work-life balance and overall job satisfaction, visualizing these metrics to identify patterns.

## Visualization and Reporting:

- **Interactive Dashboard:** The Power BI dashboard allowed users to interact with the data by filtering by job title, country, and other demographics, providing a clear view of the industry landscape.

- **Key Insights:** The dashboard offered insights into which job roles are the most rewarding, which programming skills are most in-demand, and how satisfied professionals are with their salaries and work-life balance.
